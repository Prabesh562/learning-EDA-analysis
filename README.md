# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Learning Repository

This repository documents my learning and practice journey in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.
It focuses on understanding data through visualization, statistics, and structured analysis, building a strong foundation for Machine Learning.

🚀 What I Practiced

In this repository, I practiced the following EDA concepts:

🔹 Types of Analysis

Univariate Analysis – understanding single variables

Bivariate Analysis – studying relationships between two variables

Multivariate Analysis – analyzing interactions among multiple variables

🔹 Data Handling

Basic Data Cleaning (limited usage)

Handling numerical and categorical features

🔹 Visualization

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔹 Statistical Insights

Mean, median, mode

Correlation

Distribution analysis

🔹 Automated EDA

Pandas Profiling (ydata-profiling) for quick dataset summarization

📂 Datasets Used

Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)

Used for detailed EDA, feature analysis, and profiling

Seaborn Built-in Datasets

iris

flights

Used mainly for visualization and relationship analysis

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

📘 Learning & practice of EDA concepts

🧠 Developing intuition for data before ML

🏗️ Building a strong foundation for Machine Learning projects

🧩 Learning Level

Intermediate

Assumes basic knowledge of:

Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebooks

🧠 Key Takeaways

Visualization is essential to understand data behavior

Petal features are more informative than sepal features (from Iris analysis)

Automated tools like Pandas Profiling speed up initial EDA

EDA helps in better feature selection before modeling
